            "The peacock bass is one of the most popular freshwater fish in the world. From the South American giants that lurk in the Amazon to South Florida, they are considered some of the hardiest and most colorful freshwater fish in the world.",
            " Part of the reason why they are so highly regarded around the world is because they are not actually sea bass but cichlids. There are over 1,300 species of cichlids found on four different continents, including well-known fish such as anglers, oscars, and tilapia. ",
            "Until 2006 it was believed that there were only five species of peacock bass in the entire world, but today there are 15 different recognized species. Only one of them is found in Panama, Cichla Pleiozona, which is unique in having a distinctive fourth vertical bar. ",
            "The Peacock bass we fish for today is not native to Panama, but was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s. Known locally as “sergeant,” there are two theories as to how they got here. One is that they escaped from a nearby fish farm during a flood after heavy rains, the other scenario is that they were planted by bored American soldiers who were stationed here while the Panama Canal was under American control from its opening in 1914 until 1999. The nickname “sergeant” comes from the fact that in the early decades it was mainly US military who fished them and/or the four vertical stripes on their sides as a military uniform. Come what may, the sea bass has taken over Gatun Lake and is now, without a doubt, the preeminent freshwater species."

The dorsal fin begins in the middle of the reverse and at the last ray, in the same way as the anal fin, it extends to form a filament. The pectoral fins are low and the pelvic fins are abdominal.Royal tarpon inhabit the riparian areas of the Atlantic, Florida, and in Africa at tropical latitudes. They also inhabit estuaries and even rivers and lakes. They gather in schools to chase, sometimes even freshwater, the fish on which they feed. Its meat is not particularly pleasant, but its important size makes it a desirable prey for sport fishing. "
